Chapter starts out with introducing the idea of a "data budget". The authors argue there is a careful
balance between parameter estimation, model selection and tuning, and performance assessment.  With the
finite data available, folks need to be careful 'spending' data for each of these tasks.  If data is 'reused'
folks risk compounding biases and methodological errors, thus decreasing empiral validation.

## Common methods for splitting data

- split data into two distinct sets: training and testing.
    - training is usually majority of the data
        - a sandbox for model building and fitting etc...
    - testing is the rest
        - test is the final yard stick
            - should only be looked at **once** otherwise it's a part of
            the modeling process.

```{r setup}
library(tidymodels)
tidymodels_prefer()

ames <- nanoparquet::read_parquet(fs::path_wd("data", "ames", ext = "parquet"))
```
